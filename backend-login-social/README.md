I present the FullStack Login Social project, a project that has a frontend and a backend written in typescript that offers a complete blog system developed in Node.js with and orchestrated with Docker, with the help of the Express framework and ORM Sequelize to interact with the MySQL database. This is documentation specific to the backend, an API that provides users with essential functionality, including account creation, secure login with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, creation, editing and deletion of posts.

## üê≥ Docker

  <img src="https://www.mundodocker.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/docker_facebook_share.png" alt="logo docker" width="150px">

Docker was used in this project to facilitate the configuration and execution of the development environment. With Docker, it is possible to encapsulate the application, its dependencies and the database in isolated containers, ensuring that it can run consistently in different environments.

The docker-compose.yml file defines the configuration of the containers required for the project, including the MySQL database container and the Node.js application container. With a single command, containers can be initialized, allowing the development environment to be configured quickly and easily, in addition to automated testing with jest.

## Development Environment

To develop and run this application, you need to set up an environment with the following tools:

Docker: We use Docker to package and isolate the application in containers, ensuring consistent deployment and easy dependency management.

- [How to install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

**Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is a tool that simplifies the definition and management of multi-container services in a single file, ideal for orchestrating containers related to the application.

- [How to install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### If you do not want to install Docker, you need to install Node JS on your machine

**Node.js**: The application is developed in Node.js, a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime platform, and is required to run the code.

- [How to install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

Ensure you install and configure these tools in your development environment before starting the project.

## Project standards

  <img src="https://micreiros.com/wp-content/uploads/designpatterns-720x340.png" alt="docker logo" width="150px">

The backend is based on the Model/Service/Controller (MSC) architecture, I chose this architecture because it separates the app differently, separating the responsibilities of your application into three distinct layers, promoting better organization and maintenance of the code:

**Model:** Manages the logic and representation of data, interacting directly with the database or other data sources.

**Service:** Contains the application's business logic. It is responsible for processing data between the Controller and the Model.

**Controller:** Handles HTTP requests, delegating tasks to the Service and Model layers, and returning appropriate responses to the client.

## Choice of language and framework

  <img src="https://www.devmedia.com.br/arquivos/Artigos/42224/image004.png" alt="logo docker" width="150px">

I chose node along with its express framework and the javascript/typescript language because they are easy-to-understand tools with a large community. TypeScript adds a static typing system to JavaScript, detecting errors at compile time and offering an additional layer of security to the code. It also improves code readability and maintainability by providing features like IntelliSense and autocompletion in code editors. Express is a minimalist framework that allows for greater proximity between the language and the node and the ideal javascript execution environment.

## Use of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

 <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:1200/0*UkOqM_a_agYwUOoV" alt="logo docker" width="150px">

I chose to use an ORM because it allows the decoupling of database rules, facilitating a possible change in the future, in addition to allowing the abstraction of data modeling, greater security, protection against sql injection.

I used sequelize because it is a javascript ORM, compatible with typescript, very robust, already known by the community and which provides complete database manipulation through javascript/typescript code.

## Using PostgreSQL

  <img src="https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/What-is-PostgreSQL.png" alt="docker logo" width=" 150px">

I chose PostgreSQL as the database for this project because it is a powerful, open-source, and reliable relational database management system. It offers a wide range of features, including support for complex queries, data integrity, and transactions. PostgreSQL is highly extensible, allowing you to create custom data types, functions, and extensions. Its support for JSON and JSONB data types makes it ideal for storing and querying JSON data. With its active community and regular updates, PostgreSQL is a popular choice for web applications, data warehousing, and geospatial applications.

## Use of Json Web Token (JWT)

  <img src="https://pradeepl.com/blog/jwt/JWT-Cover.png" alt="docker logo" width="150px">

As it is an application in which the user needs authentication, I opted for JWT, which offers an efficient and secure solution for authentication in web applications and APIs. It simplifies authentication by allowing user verification without the need to consult the database. each request. With its simple and standardized structure, JWT is easily implemented and interoperable across different platforms. Your ability to include custom information in the token offers control and flexibility in managing permissions and authorizations. Additionally, the digital signature ensures the integrity of the token's data, while optional encryption protects the token's contents from unauthorized access.

## Using Bcript JS

  <img src="https://codeforgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bcrypt-vs-BcryptJS.jpg" alt="docker logo" width="150px">

To avoid major problems in relation to data leaks, I used Bcript JS, a secure and well-known encryption library in the community, which allows hash comparison without the explicit need to decrypt the password. Furthermore, its flexibility allows it to adjust the computational cost of hashing to keep up with technology advancements. By using bcrypt.js, the protection of users' confidential information is ensured, promoting trust and application integrity.

## Using jest

  <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:617/0*Kbpj6uYEDOzd0kbH.png" alt="docker logo" width="150px">

Like any good backend, this one has automated tests, I used jest as a testing library, as it is very complete and does not need many dependencies to be used, it simplifies the testing process with a clear and easy-to-use syntax, in addition to offer advanced features. With its parallel execution, Jest is fast and efficient, making it ideal for large test suites. It offers built-in support for creating mocks, function spying, and snapshot testing, making it easier to create isolated tests and detect regressions. Furthermore, Jest integrates perfectly with TypeScript, allowing you to write statically typed tests. Its ability to integrate with transpiling tools like Babel and packaging tools like Webpack makes it a versatile choice for backend projects.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ElieltonRamos/project-fullstack-login-social.git
   ```
